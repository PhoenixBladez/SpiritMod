The poisons cancelled each other out and I was left with this foul-tasting, but drinkable, substance that proves to be quite potent in battle.\n\n" +

The field researchers told me that they were never going back to that 'freaky place', but that I could retrieve more Glowroot by cutting down giant mushroom trees. I must investigate soon.\n\n" +

Who would've thought that [c/95a3ab:Pink Gel] and [c/95a3ab:Daybloom] would cause me to feel so giddy! After downing this sweet stuff, I was jumping for joy- and jumping much higher than I normally would, too.";
