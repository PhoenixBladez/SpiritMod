            " But things weren't always this way. I was just like you all, once- dirt poor and owning nothing but the clothes on my back. It took everything I had to survive. But if you purchase my handy series of guides, you'll be just like me in no-time-flat! I can't wait for you to rise through the ranks, rookie.\n\n" +

Just cobble together some [c/72a4c2:stone] at a workbench and you've got a strong, bulky set of armor. It does look quite ugly, though, but that isn't a big deal. After all, you're not famous yet!\n\n" +

Well, I'm not- haven't got a magical bone in my body!
